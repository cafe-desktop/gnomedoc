This is  of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) spec, updated
. The canonical home for this document is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/" target="_top">http://www.freedesktop.org</a>,
which also contains directions for reporting bugs or contributing to future
versions.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484822464"></a>What is this spec?</h3></div></div></div><p>
This spec defines interactions between window managers, compositing
managers, applications, and the utilities that form part of a desktop
environment.  It builds on the Inter-Client Communication Conventions
Manual [<span class="citation"><a class="link" href="index.html#ICCCM">ICCCM</a></span>], which
defines window manager interactions at a lower level. The ICCCM does
not provide ways to implement many features that modern desktop users
expect. The GNOME and KDE desktop projects originally developed their
own extensions to the ICCCM to support these features; this spec
replaces those custom extensions with a standardized set of ICCCM
additions that any desktop environment can adopt.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484744832"></a>Language used in this specification</h3></div></div></div><p>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  
		</p><p>
The key words "Window Manager" refer to a window manager which is adopting this
specification.  "Pager" refers to desktop utility applications, including
pagers and taskbars.  "Application" refers to other clients.  "Clients" refers
to Pagers and Applications ie. all X clients, except for the Window Manager.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484742912"></a>Prerequisites for adoption of this specification</h3></div></div></div><p>
Window Managers and Clients which aim to fulfill this specification MUST adhere 
to the ICCCM on which this specification builds. If this specification 
explicitly modifies the ICCCM Window Managers and Clients MUST fulfill these 
modifications.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm45384484483104"></a>Non-ICCCM features</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a number of window management features or behaviors which are 
not specified in the ICCCM, but are commonly met in modern window managers and desktop environments.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484482048"></a>Additional States</h3></div></div></div><p>The ICCCM allows window managers to implement additional window states, which will 
appear to clients as substates of NormalState and IconicState.  Two 
commonly met examples are Maximized and Shaded.  A window manager may implement these
as proper substates of NormalState and IconicState, or it may treat them 
as independent flags, allowing e.g. a maximized window to be iconified
and to re-appear as maximized upon de-iconification.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm45384484480992"></a>Maximization</h4></div></div></div><p>Maximization is a very old feature of window managers.  There was even a ZoomedState
in early ICCCM drafts.  Maximizing a window should give it as much of the
screen area as possible (this may not be the full screen area, but only
a smaller 'workarea', since the window manager may have reserved certain areas for other 
windows).  A window manager is expected to remember the geometry of a maximized window 
and restore it upon de-maximization.  Modern window managers typically allow separate 
horizontal and vertical maximization.</p><p>With the introduction of the Xinerama extension in X11 R6.4, maximization
has become more involved.  Xinerama allows a screen to span multiple 
monitors in a freely configurable geometry.  In such a setting, maximizing 
a window would ideally not grow it to fill the whole screen, but only the 
monitor it is shown on.  There are of course borderline cases for windows 
crossing monitor boundaries, and 'real' maximization to the full screen may 
sometimes be useful.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm45384484478880"></a>Shading</h4></div></div></div><p>Some desktop environments offer shading (also known as rollup) as an alternative to 
iconification. A shaded window typically shows only the titlebar, the client 
window is hidden, thus shading is not useful for windows which are not 
decorated with a titlebar.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484477296"></a>Modality</h3></div></div></div><p>The WM_TRANSIENT_FOR hint of the ICCCM allows clients to specify that a 
toplevel window may be closed before the client finishes.  A typical example 
of a transient window is a dialog.  Some dialogs can be open for a long time,  
while the user continues to work in the main window.  Other dialogs have to be 
closed before the user can continue to work in the main window.  This property 
is called modality.  While clients can implement modal windows in an ICCCM 
compliant way using the globally active input model, some window managers offer support 
for handling modality.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="largedesks"></a>Large Desktops</h3></div></div></div><p>The window manager may offer to arrange the managed windows on a desktop that is 
larger than the root window. The screen functions as a viewport on this large 
desktop. Different policies regarding the positioning of the viewport on the 
desktop can be implemented:  The window manager may only allow the viewport 
position to change in increments of the screen size (paging) or it may allow
arbitrary positions (scrolling).</p><p>To fulfill the ICCCM principle that clients should behave the same
regardless whether a window manager is running or not, window managers which 
implement large desktops must interpret all client-provided geometries with 
respect to the current viewport.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="largedesksimpl"></a>Implementation note</h4></div></div></div><p>There are two options for implementing a large desktop: The first is to 
keep the managed windows (or, if reparenting, their frames) as children
of the root window.  Moving the viewport is achieved by moving all managed
windows in the opposite direction.</p><p>The second alternative is to reparent all managed windows to a dedicated 
large window (somewhat inappropriately called a 'virtual root').  Moving 
the viewport is then achieved by moving the virtual root in the opposite 
direction.</p><p>Both alternatives are completely ICCCM compliant, although the second one 
may be somewhat problematic for clients trying to figure out the window manager decorations
around their toplevel windows and for clients trying to draw background 
images on the root window.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484445296"></a>Sticky windows</h3></div></div></div><p>A window manager which implements a large desktop typically offers a way for the user 
to make certain windows 'stick to the glass', i.e. these windows will stay 
at the same position on the screen when the viewport is moved.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484444112"></a>Virtual Desktops</h3></div></div></div><p>Most X servers have only a single screen.  The window manager may virtualize this 
resource and offer multiple so-called 'virtual desktops', of which only one 
can be shown on the screen at a time.  There is some variation among the 
features of virtual desktop implementations.  There may be a fixed number 
of desktops, or new ones may be created dynamically.  The size of the desktops 
may be fixed or variable.  If the desktops are larger than the root window,

The first is to use multiple virtual roots (see <a class="xref" href="index.html#largedesksimpl" title="Implementation note">the section called “Implementation note”</a>) and change the current

completely ICCCM compliant, but has the issues outlined in <a class="xref" href="index.html#largedesksimpl" title="Implementation note">the section called “Implementation note”</a></p><p>The second option is to keep all managed windows as children of the root 
window and unmap the frames of those which are not on the current
desktop. Unmapped windows should be placed in IconicState, according to 
the ICCCM. Windows which are actually iconified or minimized 
should have the _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN property set, to 
communicate to pagers that the window should not be represented as 
"onscreen."

miniature view of the desktop(s) representing managed windows by small 
rectangles and allows the user to initiate various window manager actions by manipulating 
these representations.  Typically offered actions are activation (see <a class="xref" href="index.html#activation" title="Activation">the section called “Activation”</a>), 
moving, restacking, iconification, maximization and closing.  On a large 
desktop, the pager may offer a way to move the viewport.  On virtual desktops, 
the pager may offer ways to move windows between desktops and to change the 
current desktop.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484847680"></a>Taskbars</h3></div></div></div><p>A taskbar offers another UI for window management tasks.  It typically 
represents client windows as a list of buttons labelled with the window
titles and possibly icons.  Pressing a button initiates a window manager action on the
represented window, typical actions being activation and iconification. 
In environments with a taskbar, icons are often considered inappropriate,
since the iconified windows are already represented in the taskbar.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="activation"></a>Activation</h3></div></div></div><p>In the X world, activating a window means to give it the input focus.
This may not be possible if the window is unmapped, because it is on a
different desktop.  Thus, activating a window may involve additional steps
like moving it to the current desktop (or changing to the desktop the window
is on), deiconifying it or raising it.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484930992"></a>Animated iconification</h3></div></div></div><p>Some window managers display some form of animation when (de-)iconifying a window.

Windows platforms. Programs employing it have a single top-level window
which contains a workspace which contains the subwindows for the open

windows on the root window.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384484928224"></a>Override-redirect windows</h3></div></div></div><p>
Override-redirect windows are ignored by traditional window managers,
but not by compositing managers. Compositing managers are responsible
for painting all windows to the screen, including override-redirect
windows.
</p><p>
To enable compositing managers to decorate override-redirect window
properly, for example by making them translucent or by changing the
shape of the windows, this spec allows clients to set properties on
override-redirect windows indicating the function of the windows.

Some window managers keep the toplevel windows not in a single linear stack,
but subdivide the stack into several layers.  There is a lot of variation 
among the features of layered stacking order implementations. The number of
layers may or may not be fixed. The layer of a toplevel window may be explicit
and directly modifiable or derived from other properties of the window, e.g. 
the <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> of the window. The stacking order may or may not
be strict, i.e. not allow the user to raise or lower windows beyond their 
layer.

        When setting this property, the Pager must own a manager selection (as
	defined in the ICCCM 2.8). The manager selection is called
        _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT_S<code class="literal">n</code> where
        <code class="literal">n</code> is the screen number. The purpose of 
        this property is to allow the Window Manager to know the desktop

        </p><p>
  _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT describes the layout of virtual
  desktops relative to each other. More specifically, it describes the layout
  used by the owner of the manager selection. The Window Manager may use 
  this layout information or may choose to ignore it.
  The property contains four values: the Pager orientation, the number of
  desktops in the X direction, the number in the Y direction, and the
  starting corner of the layout, i.e. the corner containing the first desktop.
        </p><p>
   Note: In order to inter-operate with Pagers implementing an earlier
   draft of this document, Window Managers should accept a
  _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT property of length 3 and
  use _NET_WM_TOPLEFT as the starting corner in this case.
  </p><p>
  The virtual desktops are arranged in a rectangle with 
  <code class="literal">rows</code> rows and <code class="literal">columns</code> columns.
  If <code class="literal">rows</code> times <code class="literal">columns</code> does not match

        </p><p>

	allows Pagers to exactly position and resize a window including its

        This request is similar to ConfigureRequest with CWSibling and CWStackMode flags. It should be used only by pagers,

        see <a class="xref" href="index.html#sourceindication" title="Source indication in requests">the section called “Source indication in requests”</a> for details.
	</p><p>
	Rationale: A Window Manager may put restrictions on configure requests from applications, for example it may
        under some conditions refuse to raise a window. This request makes it clear it comes from a pager or similar
        tool, and therefore the Window Manager should always obey it.

  window = window for which to set _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS
  message_type = _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS
</pre><p>
A Client whose window has not yet been mapped can request of the
Window Manager an estimate of the frame extents it will be given upon
mapping.  To retrieve such an estimate, the Client MUST send a
_NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS message to the root window.  The Window
Manager MUST respond by estimating the prospective frame extents and
setting the window's _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS property accordingly.  The
Client MUST handle the resulting _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS PropertyNotify
event.  So that the Window Manager has a good basis for estimation,
the Client MUST set any window properties it intends to set
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> sending this message.  The Client MUST be able to cope
with imperfect estimates.
	</p><p>
Rationale: A client cannot calculate the dimensions of its window's
frame before the window is mapped, but some toolkits need this
information.  Asking the window manager for an estimate of the extents
is a workable solution.  The estimate may depend on the current theme,
font sizes or other window properties.  The client can track changes
to the frame's dimensions by listening for _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS
PropertyNotify events.

Cardinal to determine the desktop the window is in (or wants to be) starting

indicates that the window SHOULD appear on all desktops.  
	</p><p>
The Window Manager should honor _NET_WM_DESKTOP whenever a withdrawn window
requests to be mapped.
        </p><p>
The Window Manager should remove the property whenever
a window is withdrawn but it should leave the property in place when it is
shutting down, e.g. in response to losing ownership of the WM_Sn manager 
selection.
	</p><p>
Rationale: Removing the property upon window withdrawal helps legacy 
applications which want to reuse withdrawn windows. Not removing the property
upon shutdown allows the next Window Manager to restore windows to their 
previous desktops. 
        </p><p>
A Client can request a change of desktop for a non-withdrawn window by sending

</pre><p>
This SHOULD be set by the Client before mapping to a list of atoms indicating
the functional type of the window.  This property SHOULD be used by the window
manager in determining the decoration, stacking position and other behavior
of the window.  The Client SHOULD specify window types in order of preference
(the first being most preferable) but MUST include at least one of the basic
window type atoms from the list below.  This is to allow for extension of the
list of types whilst providing default behavior for Window Managers that do
not recognize the extensions.  
	</p><p>
This hint SHOULD also be set for override-redirect windows to allow
compositing managers to apply consistent decorations to menus,
tooltips etc.
</p><p>
Rationale:  This hint is intended to replace the MOTIF hints.  One of the
objections to the MOTIF hints is that they are a purely visual description of
the window decoration.  By describing the function of the window, the Window
Manager can apply consistent decoration and behavior to windows of the same
type.  Possible examples of behavior include keeping dock/panels on top or
allowing pinnable menus / toolbars to only be hidden when another window has
focus (NextStep style).

_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP indicates a desktop feature.  This can include a
single window containing desktop icons with the same dimensions as the screen,
allowing the desktop environment to have full control of the desktop, without
the need for proxying root window clicks.  
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK indicates a dock or panel feature.  Typically a
Window Manager would keep such windows on top of all other windows.  
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR and _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU indicate
toolbar and pinnable menu windows, respectively (i.e. toolbars and
menus "torn off" from the main application). Windows of this type may
set the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR hint indicating the main application
window. Note that the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU should be set on 
torn-off managed windows, where _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DROPDOWN_MENU and
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU are typically used on override-redirect
windows.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY indicates a small persistent utility window, such as
a palette or toolbox. It is distinct from type TOOLBAR because it does not
correspond to a toolbar torn off from the main application. It's distinct from
type DIALOG because it isn't a transient dialog, the user will probably keep it
open while they're working. Windows of this type may set the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
hint indicating the main application window.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH indicates that the window is a splash screen
displayed as an application is starting up.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG indicates that this is a dialog window.  If
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE is not set, then managed windows with
WM_TRANSIENT_FOR set MUST be taken as this type. Override-redirect
windows with WM_TRANSIENT_FOR, but without _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE must be
taken as _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DROPDOWN_MENU indicates that the
window in question is a dropdown menu, ie., the kind of menu that
typically appears when the user clicks on a menubar, as opposed to a
popup menu which typically appears when the user right-clicks on an
object. This property is typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU indicates that the
window in question is a popup menu, ie., the kind of menu that
typically appears when the user right clicks on an object, as opposed
to a dropdown menu which typically appears when the user clicks on a
menubar. This property is typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLTIP indicates that the window
in question is a tooltip, ie., a short piece of explanatory text that
typically appear after the mouse cursor hovers over an object for a
while. This property is typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION indicates a
notification. An example of a notification would be a bubble appearing
with informative text such as "Your laptop is running out of power"
etc. This property is typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_COMBO should be used on the windows that are
popped up by combo boxes. An example is a window that appears below a
text field with a list of suggested completions. This property is
typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DND indicates that the window is being
dragged. Clients should set this hint when the window in question
contains a representation of an object being dragged from one place to
another. An example would be a window containing an icon that is being
dragged from one file manager window to another. This property is
typically used on override-redirect windows.
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL indicates that this is a normal, top-level
window, either managed or override-redirect.  Managed windows with
neither _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE nor WM_TRANSIENT_FOR set MUST be taken as
this type. Override-redirect windows without _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE, must
be taken as this type, whether or not they have WM_TRANSIENT_FOR set.

A list of hints describing the window state. Atoms present in the list MUST be

Window Manager SHOULD honor
_NET_WM_STATE whenever a withdrawn window requests to be mapped.  A Client
wishing to change the state of a window MUST send a _NET_WM_STATE client
message to the root window (see below).  The Window Manager MUST keep this
property updated to reflect the current state of the window.

The Window Manager should remove the property whenever

An implementation MAY add new atoms to this list. Implementations
without extensions MUST ignore any unknown atoms, effectively removing
them from the list. These extension atoms MUST NOT start with the prefix
_NET. 
      </p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL indicates that this is a modal dialog box.  
If the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR hint is set to another toplevel window, the 
dialog is modal for that window; if WM_TRANSIENT_FOR is not set or set
to the root window the dialog is modal for its window group.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_STICKY indicates that the Window Manager SHOULD keep the
window's position fixed on the screen, even when the virtual desktop scrolls.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_{VERT,HORZ} indicates that the window is
{vertically,horizontally} maximized.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_SHADED indicates that the window is shaded.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR indicates that the window should not be
included on a taskbar. This hint should be requested by the
application, i.e. it indicates that the window by nature is never
in the taskbar.  Applications should not set this hint if
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE already conveys the exact nature of the
window.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER indicates that the window should not be
included on a Pager. This hint should be requested by the application,
i.e. it indicates that the window by nature is never in the
Pager. Applications should not set this hint if _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
already conveys the exact nature of the window.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN should be set by the Window Manager to indicate
that a window would not be visible on the screen if its
desktop/viewport were active and its coordinates were within the
screen bounds. The canonical example is that minimized windows should
be in the _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN state.  Pagers and similar applications
should use _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN instead of WM_STATE to decide whether
to display a window in miniature representations of the windows on a
desktop.
        </p><p>
Implementation note: if an Application asks to toggle
_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN the Window Manager should probably just ignore
the request, since _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN is a function of some other
aspect of the window such as minimization, rather than an independent
state.
</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicates that the window should fill the entire
	screen and have no window decorations. Additionally the Window
	Manager is responsible for restoring the original geometry after a
	switch from fullscreen back to normal window. For example, a
	presentation program would use this hint.
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE indicates that the window should be on top of most 
windows (see <a class="xref" href="index.html#STACKINGORDER" title="Stacking order">the section called “Stacking order”</a> for details). 
        </p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_BELOW indicates that the window should be below most 
windows (see <a class="xref" href="index.html#STACKINGORDER" title="Stacking order">the section called “Stacking order”</a> for details). 
       </p><p>
	_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW are mainly meant for user
	preferences and should not be used by applications e.g. for drawing 
	attention to their dialogs (the Urgency
	hint should be used in that case, see <a class="xref" href="index.html#URGENCY" title="Urgency">the section called “Urgency”</a>).' 
       </p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION indicates that some action in or with the window
happened. For example, it may be set by the Window Manager if the window requested
activation but the Window Manager refused it, or the application may set it if it
finished some work. This state may be set by both the Client and
the Window Manager. It should be unset by the Window Manager when it decides
the window got the required attention (usually, that it got activated).
	</p><p>
_NET_WM_STATE_FOCUSED indicates whether the window's decorations are drawn in an
active state. Clients MUST regard it as a read-only hint. It cannot be set at
map time or changed via a _NET_WM_STATE client message. The window given by
_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW will usually have this hint, but at times other windows may
as well, if they have a strong association with the active window and will be
considered as a unit with it by the user. Clients that modify the appearance of
internal elements when a toplevel has keyboard focus SHOULD check for the
availability of this state in _NET_SUPPORTED and, if it is available,
use it in preference to tracking focus via FocusIn events. By doing so they will
match the window decorations and accurately reflect the intentions of the Window
Manager.
	</p><p>
To change the state of a mapped window, a Client MUST send a _NET_WM_STATE
client message to the root window:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">  window  = the respective client window

  data.l[3] = source indication
  other data.l[] elements = 0
</pre><p>
This message allows two properties to be changed simultaneously, specifically
to allow both horizontal and vertical maximization to be altered together.
l[2] MUST be set to zero if only one property is to be changed.
See <a class="xref" href="index.html#sourceindication" title="Source indication in requests">the section called “Source indication in requests”</a> for details on the source indication.
l[0], the action, MUST be one of:

</pre><p>
This property is equivalent to a _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL property where all start
values are 0 and all end values are the height or width of the logical screen.
_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL was introduced later than _NET_WM_STRUT, however, so
clients MAY set this property in addition to _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL to ensure
backward compatibility with Window Managers supporting older versions of the
Specification.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384480046848"></a>_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL</h3></div></div></div><a name="NETWMSTRUTPARTIAL"></a><pre class="programlisting">_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL, left, right, top, bottom, left_start_y, left_end_y,
right_start_y, right_end_y, top_start_x, top_end_x, bottom_start_x,
bottom_end_x,CARDINAL[12]/32
</pre><p>
This property MUST be set by the Client if the window is to reserve space at the
edge of the screen.  The property contains 4 cardinals specifying the width of
the reserved area at each border of the screen, and an additional 8 cardinals
specifying the beginning and end corresponding to each of the four struts.  The
order of the values is left, right, top, bottom, left_start_y, left_end_y,
right_start_y, right_end_y, top_start_x, top_end_x, bottom_start_x,
bottom_end_x. All coordinates are root window coordinates. The client MAY change
this property at any time, therefore the Window Manager MUST watch for
property notify events if the Window Manager uses this property to assign
special semantics to the window.
	</p><p>
If both this property and the _NET_WM_STRUT property are set, the Window Manager
MUST ignore the _NET_WM_STRUT property values and use instead the values for
_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL.  This will ensure that Clients can safely set both
properties without giving up the improved semantics of the new property.
	</p><p>
The purpose of struts is to reserve space at the borders of the
desktop.  This is very useful for a docking area, a taskbar or a panel,
for instance. The Window Manager should take this reserved area into
account when constraining window positions - maximized windows, for
example, should not cover that area.
	</p><p> 
The start and end values associated with each strut allow areas to be
reserved which do not span the entire width or height of the screen.
Struts MUST be specified in root window coordinates, that is, they are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> relative to the edges of any view port or Xinerama
monitor.
	</p><p>
For example, for a panel-style Client appearing at the bottom of the
screen, 50 pixels tall, and occupying the space from 200-600 pixels
from the left of the screen edge would set a bottom strut of 50, and
set bottom_start_x to 200 and bottom_end_x to 600.  Another example is
a panel on a screen using the Xinerama extension.  Assume that the set
up uses two monitors, one running at 1280x1024 and the other to the
right running at 1024x768, with the top edge of the two physical
displays aligned.  If the panel wants to fill the entire bottom edge
of the smaller display with a panel 50 pixels tall, it should set a
bottom strut of 306, with bottom_start_x of 1280, and bottom_end_x of
2303.  Note that the strut is relative to the screen edge, and not the
edge of the xinerama monitor.
	</p><p>
Rationale: A simple "do not cover" hint is not enough for dealing with e.g.
auto-hide panels. 
	</p><p>
Notes: An auto-hide panel SHOULD set the strut to be its minimum, hidden size.
A "corner" panel that does not extend for the full length of a screen border
SHOULD only set one strut.

<span class="quote">“<span class="quote"> to a string that forms the name of the machine running the client as

</pre><p>
This property contains the XServer time at which last user activity in this
window took place.
        </p><p>
Clients should set this property on every new toplevel window (or on the window 
pointed out by the _NET_WM_USER_TIME_WINDOW property), before mapping
the window, to the timestamp of the user interaction that caused the window to
appear.  A client that only deals with core events, might, for example, use the
timestamp of the last KeyPress or ButtonPress event. ButtonRelease and
KeyRelease events should not generally be considered to be user interaction,
because an application may receive KeyRelease events from global keybindings,
and generally release events may have later timestamp than actions that were
triggered by the matching press events.  Clients can obtain the timestamp that
caused its first window to appear from the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment
variable, if the app was launched with startup notification.  If the client does
not know the timestamp of the user interaction that caused the first window to
appear (e.g. because it was not launched with startup notification), then it
should not set the property for that window.  The special value of zero on a
newly mapped window can be used to request that the window not be initially
focused when it is mapped.
        </p><p>
If the client has the active window, it should also update this property
on the window whenever there's user activity.
        </p><p>
Rationale: This property allows a Window Manager to alter the focus,
stacking, and/or placement behavior of windows when they are
mapped depending on whether the new window was created by a user
action or is a "pop-up" window activated by a timer or some other
event.

This property contains the XID of a window on which the client sets
the _NET_WM_USER_TIME property. Clients should check whether the 
window manager supports _NET_WM_USER_TIME_WINDOW and fall back to 
setting the _NET_WM_USER_TIME property on the toplevel window if it 
doesn't. 
        </p><p>
Rationale: Storing the frequently changing _NET_WM_USER_TIME property
on the toplevel window itself causes every application that is   
interested in any of the properties of that window to be woken up   
on every keypress, which is particularly bad for laptops running on 
battery power.

</pre><p>
The Client MAY set this property to a list of 4-tuples [x, y, width,
height], each representing a rectangle in window coordinates where the
pixels of the window's contents have a fully opaque alpha value. If
the window is drawn by the compositor without adding any transparency,
then such a rectangle will occlude whatever is drawn behind it. When
the window has an RGB visual rather than an ARGB visual, this property
is not typically useful, since the effective opaque region of a
window is exactly the bounding region of the window as set via the
shape extension.  For windows with an ARGB visual and also a bounding
region set via the shape extension, the effective opaque region is
given by the intersection of the region set by this property and the
bounding region set via the shape extension. The compositing manager
MAY ignore this hint.
        </p><p>
Rationale: This gives the compositing manager more room for optimizations.
For example, it can avoid drawing occluded portions behind the window.

</pre><p>
The Client MAY set this property to hint the compositor that the
window would benefit from running uncomposited (i.e not redirected
offscreen) or that the window might be hurt from being uncomposited.
A value of 0 indicates no preference. A value of 1 hints the
compositor to disabling compositing of this window. A value of 2 hints
the compositor to not disabling compositing of this window. All other
values are reserved and should be treated the same as a value of
0. The compositing manager MAY bypass compositing for both fullscreen
and non-fullscreen windows if bypassing is requested, but MUST NOT
bypass if it would cause differences from the composited appearance.
        </p><p>
Rationale: Some applications like fullscreen games might want run
without the overhead of being redirected offscreen (to avoid extra
copies) and thus perform better. An application which creates
pop-up windows might always want to run composited to avoid exposes.

This protocol allows the Window Manager to determine if the Client is still
processing X events.  This can be used by the Window Manager to determine if a
window which fails to close after being sent WM_DELETE_WINDOW has stopped
responding or has stalled for some other reason, such as waiting for user
confirmation.  A Client SHOULD indicate that it is willing to participate in
this protocol by listing _NET_WM_PING in the WM_PROTOCOLS property of the
client window.
		</p><p>
A Window Manager can use this protocol at any time by sending a client message
as follows:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">type = ClientMessage
window = the respective client window
message_type = WM_PROTOCOLS
format = 32
data.l[0] = _NET_WM_PING
data.l[1] = timestamp
data.l[2] = the respective client window
other data.l[] elements = 0
</pre><p>
A participating Client receiving this message MUST send it back to the root
window immediately, by setting window = root, and calling XSendEvent with
the same event mask like all other root window messages in this specification use.
The Client MUST NOT alter any field in the event other than the window. This
includes all 5 longs in the data.l[5] array. The Window Manager can uniquely
identify the ping by the timestamp and the data.l[2] field if necessary.
Note that some older clients may not preserve data.l[2] through data.l[4].
		</p><p>
The Window Manager MAY kill the Client (using _NET_WM_PID) if it fails to
respond to this protocol within a reasonable time.

This protocol uses the XSync extension (see <a class="ulink" href="http://freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xorg/xc/doc/hardcopy/Xext/sync.PS.gz" target="_top">the
protocol specification</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xorg/xc/doc/hardcopy/Xext/synclib.PS.gz" target="_top">
the library documentation</a>) to let client and window manager
synchronize the repaint of the window manager frame and the client
window. A client indicates that it is willing to participate in the
protocol by listing _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST in the WM_PROTOCOLS property
of the client window and storing the XID of an XSync counter in the
property _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER. The initial value of this
counter is not defined by this specification.
		</p><p>
A window manager uses this protocol by preceding a ConfigureNotify
event sent to a client by a client message as follows:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">type = ClientMessage
window = the respective client window
message_type = WM_PROTOCOLS
format = 32
data.l[0] = _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST
data.l[1] = timestamp
data.l[2] = low 32 bits of the update request number
data.l[3] = high 32 bits of the update request number
other data.l[] elements = 0
</pre><p>
After receiving one or more such message/ConfigureNotify pairs, and
having handled all repainting associated with the ConfigureNotify
events, the client MUST set the _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER to the 64
bit number indicated by the data.l[2] and data.l[3] fields of the last
client message received.
		</p><p>
By using either the Alarm or the Await mechanisms of the XSync
extension, the window manager can know when the client has finished
handling the ConfigureNotify events. The window manager SHOULD not
resize the window faster than the client can keep up.
		</p><p>
The update request number in the client message is determined by the
window manager subject to the restriction that it MUST NOT be 0. The
number is generally intended to be incremented by one for each message
sent. Since the initial value of the XSync counter is not defined by
this specification, the window manager MAY set the value of the XSync
counter at any time, and MUST do so when it first manages a new
window.

      </p><p>
A Client wishing to change this list MUST send a _NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS

By including this hint in _NET_SUPPORTED the Window Manager announces
that it performs reasonable window placement for all window types it supports
(for example centering dialogs on the mainwindow or whatever handling the
Window Manager considers reasonable). This in turn means that Clients,
when they detect that this hint is supported, SHOULD NOT abuse or often even
use PPosition and USPosition hints for requesting placement. In particular:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>USPosition is reserved to be used only to indicate that the position was 
specified by the user and MUST NOT be used for anything else (see ICCCM

position should be used. Position SHOULD NOT be specified for "default" 
placement such as centering dialog windows on their mainwindow.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Rationale: Window managers can often perform better placement (that may be 
even configurable) for windows than the application. However at the time of 
writing this it is problematic for Window managers to decide when to use them 
because many applications abuse positioning flags and/or provide unnecessary 
default positions.

This spec suggests implementing the file manager desktop by mapping a

	/ desire additional functionality beyond what can be achieved using the
	mechanisms set out in this specification may choose to implement their
	own pagers, which communicate with the Window Manager using further,
	window manager specific hints, or some other means.
	</p><p>
        Pagers should decide whether to show a miniature version of a
        window using the following guidelines:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                If either _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER or
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN are set on a window, then the
                pager should not show that window.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                The pager may choose not to display windows with 
                certain semantic types; this spec has no
                recommendations, but common practice is to avoid 
                displaying _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK for example.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                If the _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER and
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN hints are not present, and the
                Window Manager claims to support _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
                then the window should be shown if it's in either
                NormalState or IconicState.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                For Window Managers that do not support
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN, the pager should 
                not show windows in IconicState. These Window 
                Managers are probably using an older version 
                of this specification.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>

Window manager implementors should refer to the ICCCM for definitive
specifications of how to handle MapRequest and ConfigureRequest events.
However, since these aspects of the ICCCM are easily misread, this
document offers the following clarifications:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Window Managers MUST honor the win_gravity field of WM_NORMAL_HINTS
for both MapRequest <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> ConfigureRequest events 
(ICCCM Version 2.0, §4.1.2.3 and §4.1.5)
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
When generating synthetic ConfigureNotify events, the position given
MUST be the top-left corner of the client window in relation to the
origin of the root window (i.e., ignoring win_gravity) 
(ICCCM Version 2.0, §4.2.3)
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Window Managers maintain a reference point for each client window and place 
the window relative to this reference point depending on the window's 
win_gravity as follows:
		</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1" class="informaltable"><colgroup><col></col><col></col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>win_gravity:</td><td>placed at the reference point</td></tr><tr><td>StaticGravity</td><td>the left top corner of the client window</td></tr><tr><td>NorthWestGravity</td><td>the left top corner of the frame window</td></tr><tr><td>NorthGravity</td><td>the center of the frame window's top side</td></tr><tr><td>NorthEastGravity</td><td>the right top corner of the frame window</td></tr><tr><td>EastGravity</td><td>the center of the frame window's right side</td></tr><tr><td>SouthEastGravity</td><td>the right bottom corner of the frame window</td></tr><tr><td>SouthGravity</td><td>the center of the frame window's bottom side</td></tr><tr><td>SouthWestGravity</td><td>the left bottom corner of the frame window</td></tr><tr><td>WestGravity</td><td>the center of the frame window's left side</td></tr><tr><td>CenterGravity</td><td>the center of the frame window</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Applications are free to change their win_gravity setting at any time.
		</p><p>
If an Application changes its win_gravity then the Window Manager should 
adjust the reference point, so that the client window will not move as the 
result. For example if the Application's win_gravity was NorthWestGravity and 
reference point was at the top-left corner of the frame window, then after 
change of win_gravity to SouthEastGravity the reference point should be 
adjusted to point to the lower-right corner of the frame.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> 
Changing the win_gravity for a single configure request and back afterwards is
unlikely to work as intended, due to a race condition. The window manager sees
a property notify for WM_NORMAL_HINTS, followed by the configure request,
followed by another property notify for WM_NORMAL_HINTS. By the time the
window manager gets around to request the changed WM_NORMAL_HINTS in response
to the first property notify, the server may have already processed the second
property change.  
                </p><p>
If the window manager supports it, applications should use 
_NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW with a specified gravity to avoid this problem.
                </p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If the Application requests a new position (x, y) (and possibly also a 
new size), the Window Manager calculates a new reference point (ref_x, ref_y),
based on the client window's (possibly new) size (width, height), border 
width (bw) and win_gravity as explained in the table below.
                </p><p>
The Window Manager will use the new reference point until the next request for 
a new position. 
		</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1" class="informaltable"><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>win_gravity:</td><td>ref_x:</td><td>ref_y:</td></tr><tr><td>StaticGravity</td><td>x</td><td>y</td></tr><tr><td>NorthWestGravity</td><td>x-bw</td><td>y-bw</td></tr><tr><td>NorthGravity</td><td>x+(width/2)</td><td>y-bw</td></tr><tr><td>NorthEastGravity</td><td>x+width+bw</td><td>y-bw</td></tr><tr><td>EastGravity</td><td>x+width+bw</td><td>y+(height/2)</td></tr><tr><td>SouthEastGravity</td><td>x+width+bw</td><td>y+height+bw</td></tr><tr><td>SouthGravity</td><td>x+(width/2)</td><td>y+height+bw</td></tr><tr><td>SouthWestGravity</td><td>x-bw</td><td>y+height+bw</td></tr><tr><td>WestGravity</td><td>x-bw</td><td>y+(height/2)</td></tr><tr><td>CenterGravity</td><td>x+(width/2)</td><td>y+(height/2)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If an Application requests just a new size, its reference point does not 
move. So for example if client window has win_gravity SouthEastGravity and 
is resized, the bottom right corner of its frame will not move but instead
the top left corner will be adjusted by the difference in size.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
When calculating the reference point at the time of initial placement,
the Window Manager should take the initial window's size into consideration, 
as if it was the frame for this window.
		</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm45384479920784"></a>Window-in-Window MDI</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The authors of this specification acknowledge that there is no standard
	method to allow the Window Manager to manage windows that are part of a
	Window-in-Window MDI application.  Application authors are advised to
	use some other form of MDI, or to propose a mechanism to be included in
	a future revision of this specification.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KILLINGWINDOWS"></a>Killing Hung Processes</h3></div></div></div><p>
If processes fail to respond to the _NET_WM_PING protocol _NET_WM_PID may be
used in combination with the ICCCM specified WM_CLIENT_MACHINE to 
attempt to kill a process.
		</p><p>
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE is usually set by calling XSetWMProperties(). The hostname for the current host can be be retrieved using gethostname(), when gethostname()
is not available on the platform implementors may use the value of the
nodename field of struct utsname as returned by uname(). Note also that the value of WM_CLIENT_MACHINE is not guaranteed
to be a fully fully-qualified domain name of the host. An example of how to
retrieve the hostname:
		</p><p>
	</p><pre class="programlisting">int net_get_hostname (char *buf, size_t maxlen)
{
#ifdef HAVE_GETHOSTNAME
	if (buf == NULL) return 0;

	gethostname (buf, maxlen);
	buf [maxlen - 1] = '\0';

	return strlen(buf);
#else
	struct utsname name;
	size_t len;

	if (buf == NULL) return 0;

	uname (&amp;name);
	len = strlen (name.nodename);

	if (len &gt;= maxlen) len = maxlen - 1;
	strncpy (buf, name.nodename, len);
	buf[len] = '\0';

	return len;
#endif
}
</pre><p>
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="STACKINGORDER"></a>Stacking order</h3></div></div></div><p>
	To obtain good interoperability between different Desktop Environments,
	the following layered stacking order is recommended, from the bottom:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>windows not belonging in any other layer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK (unless they have
	      state _NET_WM_TYPE_BELOW) and windows having state
	      _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>focused windows having state
	      _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
	Windows that are transient for another window should be kept 
	above this window.
      </p><p>
	The window manager may choose to put some windows in different 
	stacking positions, for example to allow the user to bring currently
	a active window to the top and return it back when the window looses
	focus.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sourceindication"></a>Source indication in requests</h3></div></div></div><p>
          Some requests from Clients include type of the Client, for example
          the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message. Currently the types can be
          1 for normal applications, and 2 for pagers and other Clients
          that represent direct user actions (the Window Manager may decide
          to treat requests from applications differently than requests
          that are result of direct user actions).
          Clients that support only older version of this spec will have 0
          as their source indication, thus not specifying their source at all.
          This also may mean that some of the fields in the message comply
          only with the older specification version.
